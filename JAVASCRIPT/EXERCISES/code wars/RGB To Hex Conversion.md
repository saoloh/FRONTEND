# how to turn RGB  to HEX

For example, with **148**:  
- Divide once: \(148 \div 16 = 9\) remainder \(4\).  
- That means the hex digits are **9** and **4** → so the hex is **94**.  

So the “easier way” is:  
1. Divide the decimal by 16 once.  
2. The quotient is the first hex digit.  
3. The remainder is the second hex digit.
