# Directory Overview

This directory appears to be a personal knowledge base for learning and studying various subjects, primarily focused on software development and security. The root directory contains several subdirectories, each dedicated to a specific topic:

*   **JAVASCRIPT:** This section is dedicated to learning JavaScript, with subdirectories for exercises, notes, projects, and resources.
    *   **ELZERO TASKS:** A sub-directory within `EXERCISES` containing solutions to the Elzero Web School's JavaScript assignments.
*   **REACT:** This section is for learning the React framework, with a similar structure to the JavaScript directory.

# Key Files

The directory structure is the primary organizational tool. While no key files with content were identified, the `STUDY PLAN.md` files within each topic directory were likely intended to provide a roadmap for learning.

# Usage

This directory is intended for personal study and reference. The user can navigate to the relevant topic directory to find notes, resources, and exercises. The `PROJECTS` subdirectories are likely for hands-on practice and application of the learned concepts.
